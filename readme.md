## Objectives

Create an app that allows the users store and manage links to important resources so that they have a centralized database of links pending review, and so that they can plan when to see them depending on their shcedules.

The app will also let users see other people's links (but won't let them edit or delete that link), and will allow them to comment on the link.

## Features

- The app lets users mark links as favorites.
- The app displays viewed links and new links in different areas to make them easier to manage.
- The app highlights in red links pending review once their planned date has passed.
